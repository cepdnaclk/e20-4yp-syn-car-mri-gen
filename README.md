# Synthetic Cardiac MRI Image Generation using Deep Generative Models
___

## Problem Statement
Medical image data is critical for developing AI tools, yet often inaccessible due to privacy concerns and there are only limited publicly available data.<br>
This project aims to apply advanced deep generative models (such as Diffusion and Flow Matching) to address this limitation, improving downstream tasks like segmentation while preserving patient privacy.
